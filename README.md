# Welcome
Welcome to the Zoom.js Documentation by Unzor.

‏‏‎
# What is this documentation for?
This documentation lists the usage and instructions for Zoom.js.

‏‏‎
# Getting started
To set up the library, download the Zoom.js file.

‏‏‎

# Usage
After adding it to your site, use this to join a Zoom meeting, as seen in the example:
```
new ZoomJS(meeting id here);
```

ZoomJS only has one function, but more will be added later on.

I am currently trying to add passwords, but I will have to find a way to encode the passwords, as when you join a Zoom meeting through a link, it will have this fancy parameter:
```
?pwd=elg0SVdrdExTMXpNVGtDUXFxUDRJQT09
```
